## Environment Variables

To run the project correctly, you must set the required environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory based on the `.env.example` file. Below is a description of the required variables:

| Variable                       | Description                                               | Example Value                         |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET_KEY`      | Secret key used to sign access tokens                     | `your-access-token-secret-key`        |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET_KEY`     | Secret key used for authenticating with Google APIs       | `your-google-secret-key`              |
| `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`          | The URI where Google redirects users after authentication | `http://localhost:3030/auth/callback` |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`             | Unique identifier for your Google API client	             | `your-google-client-id`               |
| `PORT`                         | The port where the server will listen                     | `3030`                                |

## Conventional Commits

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification to maintain a clean and consistent commit history.

### Commitizen: How to Use

1. Stage your changes:

    ```bash
    git add [<pathspec>...]
    ```

2. Commit using `Commitizen`:

    ```bash
    npm run git:commit
    ```

3. Follow the interactive prompts.
    `Commitizen` will guide you through crafting a proper commit message.

### Message Structure

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Example:
```bash
feat(auth): add login functionality
```

## Result Pattern

This project uses the **Go-based Result Pattern** to manage type-safe operation results. The `Result` type provides a type-safe way to handle both successful and failed operations.

### Defining `Result`

To define a result, use the generic type `Result<F, S>`, where:
- `F`: represents the type of the failure (failed result).
- `S`: represents the type of the success (successful result).

#### Example:

Below is an example of a division function. If the operation fails (e.g., division by zero), the result contains a DivisionByZeroError. Otherwise, it contains a number.

```ts
function divide(dividend: number, divisor: number): Result<DivisionByZeroError, number> {
    // Implementation goes here
}
```

### Returning `Result`

To return a result, use:
- `failure(F)`: for failed outcomes, passing the result value (`F`).
- `success(S)`: for successful outcomes, passing the result value (`S`).

#### Example:

Here‚Äôs the implementation of the divide function using `failure(F)` for failure and `success(S)` for success:

```ts
function divide(dividend: number, divisor: number): Result<DivisionByZeroError, number> {
    
    if (divisor === 0) {
        return failure(new DivisionByZeroError());
    }

    return success(dividend / divisor);

}
```

### Handling `Result`

To handle a result, use the `successfully()` and `failed()` methods of `Result` to determine the return type. Then, access the corresponding value safely.

#### Example:

Here‚Äôs an example of using the divide function to calculate the division of `x` and `y`:

```ts

const result = divide(x, y); // Get the result

if (result.failed()) {
    throw result.value; // Handle the error (e.g., throw)
}

console.log(`Result: ${result.value}`); // Process the success value

```

## RBAC - Role-based Access Control

This project uses Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions based on their roles.

### Roles:

1. Administrator;
2. Employee;
3. Student;
4. Pending;
5. Anonymous.

### Permissions:

|                       | Administrator | Employee         | Student          | Pending | Anonymous |
